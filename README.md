OpenSuseVagrantBox
==================

Work to create a Vagrant Box for an OpenSuse VM.  Track issues as well as create tutorial for how to if you want to build, improve your own.

## Just Want the Box?

If you are just looking for the box to download and use/try/test, here are the links for the latest:
	
* OpenSuse 12.1 x64 -- [OpenSuse12_1_x64_July14.box](https://s3.amazonaws.com/circlejtp/OpenSuseVagrant/OpenSuse12_1x64_July14.box)
* OpenSuse 12.1 x32 -- _ComingSoon_

## Find A Problem?

Please open a new issue and I will see what I can do.

##How To Build Your Own

OpenSuse has a few tricks and tips.  I used these resources, but will be putting together a tutorial that I hope is more consistent.  Basically one that works for me.

There are some specific quirks around the disk ids and network devices that need to be illustrated.
